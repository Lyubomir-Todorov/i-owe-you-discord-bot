## Why Use This Bot?

This bot was created to simplify expense tracking for two individuals, removing the need to manually update a shared spreadsheet.

The bot doesn't require commands to add entries. Instead, it uses regular Discord messages with a flexible syntax that is very forgiving and can make a lot of assumptions on your behalf. This is especially useful when you're outside and want to add an entry immediately after making a purchase, so you don't forget to do it later.

The short message syntax also works well for quickly adding entries using your phone's voice dictation.

## Submitting Entries

Messages are parsed using regular expressions and consist of four parts:

### Required arguments

-   `Amount` - The cost of the purchase
-   `Description` - The description of what was purchased

### Optional arguments

-   `Name` - The name of the person who made the purchase
    -   The name / nickname of the other person can be used to indicate that the amount is owed to them
    -   If no name is found, the name of the user who submitted the message will be used
-   `Category` - Text that matches one of the configured categories / category keywords will be used as the category
    -   If no category is found, the default category will be used
-   `Split` - How the purchase should be divided, this can either by `50/50`, or `Paid in full by other`
    -   By default, this is assumed to be `50/50` 

### Full length message example

```
John spent $12.48 for Netflix in subscriptions
```

### Shortened message example

Assuming John is the user writing this message, and Netflix is a keyword for the subscriptions category, the example above can be shortened to:

```
12.48 Netflix
```

## Commands

`/balance (month)` - Shows the current balance of the user. If no month is specified, the balance of the current month will be shown

`/pay (month)` - Add an entry to pay off any outstanding balances. If no month is specified, the balance will be paid off for the current month
